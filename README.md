# MotoRacerGame



This is a simple motoracer game which we all have played at least once in our childhood. I tries recreating it while practicing on 'Pygame' module.


The 'Moto Racer.py' file is the main file of the project, it has all the code to run the game. 

The 'res' folder contains the images that are blitted(shown) on the screen and the audio played when the game starts.Also the 'sysres' file is basically a text file with no extension (cause I removed it), it basically stores the high score data from the game (cheap fix).

Dependencies:
--- It needs PYgame module to be installed to run.( To install pygame, simply type 'pip install pygame' in the command prompt.)


Welcoming all changes!!
